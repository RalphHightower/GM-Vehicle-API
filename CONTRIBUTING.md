Guidelines:
* Please avoid the inclusion of non-essential third-party libraries.
* Please avoid significant changes to the design without very good reason and include explanation in PR comments.
* Please avoid unnecessary complexity, or style changes that make the code harder to follow without good reason. (e.g. DI, IoC, stupid method names, etc...)
* Please include code docs on all public methods and types, and comments explaining things that aren't obvious
* Be nice
